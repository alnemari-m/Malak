To download Arch Linux using an existing Arch Linux live USB, you can follow these steps:

1. Boot into your Arch Linux live USB.

2. Connect to the internet if you haven't already:
   - For wired connections, it should connect automatically
   - For wireless: use `iwctl` to connect to WiFi

3. Create a directory to mount your target storage device:
   ```
   mkdir /mnt/usb
   ```

4. Identify your target USB drive with:
   ```
   lsblk
   ```

5. Mount your target USB drive (replace sdX with your actual device):
   ```
   mount /dev/sdX /mnt/usb
   ```

6. Download the latest Arch Linux ISO (replace the URL with the latest version or choose a mirror closer to you):
   ```
   curl -o /mnt/usb/archlinux.iso https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/iso/latest/archlinux-x86_64.iso
   ```

7. Verify the download (optional but recommended):
   ```
   curl -o /mnt/usb/archlinux.iso.sig https://geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com/iso/latest/archlinux-x86_64.iso.sig
   pacman-key -v /mnt/usb/archlinux.iso.sig
   ```

8. Unmount the drive:
   ```
   umount /mnt/usb
   ```

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
